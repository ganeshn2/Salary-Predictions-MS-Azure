# Salary-Predictions-MS-Azure
Salary predictions based on classifier algorithms-Logistic, Boosted Decision Tree, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines and Decision Forest ML algorithms. 

All five algorithms were subjected to "Annual Census Income dataset" available in MS-Azure collection of datasets. Subsequently, prediction of  "Tarrant County dataset" was carried out using trained models based on these algorithms mentioned above. 

Based on commonly utilized metrics (Precision, Accuracy, and Recall), Decision Forest ML algorithm seem to be most appropriate for predicting the salary classes (<50K or >50K). 

In this repository, individual metrics and subsequent salary predictions for all ML algorithms are added as CSV files. 

Flowcharts for performing the ML algorithms and predictive experiments in Azure ML is also provided ( weblinks).
